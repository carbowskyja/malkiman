caress then bite then caress again
(caress and bite and caress again)
what can't one do that one's body can
(what can't )
unless deprived of sweet oxygen
(unless )
caress then bite then caress again

grasp the desire to inflict pain
()
sensations have been bleak and plain
(sensations have been wasted in vain)
before it gets too hard to maintain
(before it gets too sick to explain)
grasp the desire to inflict pain

feel the need for aftercare
(feel the need for gentle)
red markings blossom here and there
(green bruises show up here and there)
who said this game is gonna be fair
(who said this life is gonna be fair)
feel the need for aftercare
